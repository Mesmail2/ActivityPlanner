./a.out

I designed this program at the start of Covid as a activity manager once the stay at home mandate had been lifted. I decided to test my implementation using  Doubly linked list of arrays data structure. I utilized inheritance and derived classes to get more familiar with the object oriented design process and as abstract as possible, shielding the user from the kind of data structure we are using. Please look inside the files for a detailed look at all the functions.
